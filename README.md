# Force Delete
This repo contains force delete script, this only works with windows at the moment and I don't have any plan on adding other competiable scripts for other OS.
## Compatibility
- Windows
## Instructions
Drag the file on desk onto this script .bat file, it should release the usage and occupancy state and delete it.
## Disclaimer
I got this idea from a youtube video but couldn't find it anymore or from any open source, so built this one for myself and shared here.
